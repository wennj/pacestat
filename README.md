## Introduction

This is tool is a small R shiny web app to analyse times that were run by a running event. The example data includes the times that were run by a marathon event in Germany in September 2022. The real times were modified by +/- a random number of a few seconds. 

Two graphs are created:  
+ A histogram for the run time distirubtion, 
+ A boxplot for each age class.


## Installation

Simply clone this repository and run the web app.
